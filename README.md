# Real Analysis - Kenneth A. Ross: Elementary Analysis

This repository contains my **lecture notes** and **exercise solutions** from *Kenneth A. Ross: Elementary Analysis, The Theory of Calculus (Second Edition)*. The focus is on understanding Real Analysis to support advanced topics in **Probability**, **Statistical Inference**, and **Machine Learning**.

---

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Introduction**: Natural numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, completeness axiom.
2. **Sequences**: Limits, Cauchy sequences, and convergence theorems.

---

## Repository Structure
- **Lecture Notes**: Summaries of key concepts.
- **Exercise Solutions**: Solved exercises (some skipped or deferred due to time constraints).

---

## Purpose
These notes and solutions reflect my effort to strengthen my understanding of Real Analysis, a critical mathematical discipline. My goal is to build a rigorous theoretical foundation that supports advanced topics in **Probability Theory**, **Statistical Inference**, and **Optimization**, which are essential for my future work in **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and **Robotics** research.

Whenever possible, I aim to document my work in LaTeX for clarity and professional presentation.

---

## Note
Not all problems from the textbook are solvedâ€”some are skipped or deferred to be completed later.
